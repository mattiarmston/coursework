# A-Level Coursework

Created as part of my A-Level Computer Science coursework, this website allows
users to play cards online with their friends. However most card games have many
different variations and house rules which most websites do not cater to --
instead picking a single set of rules for all users. My project was designed to
fix this issue by providing users with a large list of variations and allowing
them to pick the ones that suited them.

Written in Python it uses Flask as a framework and functional programming
techniques, such as currying, to dynamically create a function corresponding to
the variations the users specified. Whilst the website is missing features I
believe that I have created a template and structure that can be followed to add
more variations in the future.

A demonstration can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/UJBNvw-5-iw) and the
[write up](./write_up.pdf) as part of this repo.
